Do you get emails that end with inspirational signatures like "Do or do not. There is no try. ~Abraham Lincoln"? Do you wish you could have your own signature with a quote that is overused, clichéd, or just plain baffling, complete with a (probably) misidentified author?

- Get a GIF related to your quote's topic for that extra touch of professionalism
- Want another GIF? Click on a keyword in the quote to generate a new GIF based on that word (Coming soon!)
